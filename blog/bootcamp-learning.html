    <h1>Boot Camp Learning Plan</h1>
   
    <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</em></h2>
    
    <p>
        I want to transition into a developer role at a company. Start off small and then climb my way up. I can potentially work on side-projects that cover both  until I can transition design and development until i get a full-time job.
    </p>
    
    <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
    
    <p>
        The biggest strenghts will be working alongside people that are in the same boat as me. It will helpful as in person you can get help there and then.
        The biggest limitations will be making and sticking to a timeframe as in foundations it was all online based with no limit to when and what time. Working with a team will help resolve that issue
    </p>

    <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
    
    <p>
    It will be juggling thr Bootcamp and my personal life. Trying to find a bit of balance will be difficult but not impossible.
    </p>

    <h2>What non-technical skills (human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
    
    <p>
    To be more confident in my self and skills. Even though i know i am on the right track i doubt myslef and tell myself im not. 
    </p>

    <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
    
    <p>
     guidance and help when i need it or when they see fit. 
    </p>


    <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h2>
    
    <p>
     It is to give it my best shot and pass. At the end of the day i can tell myself i did not give up and gave it my all.I also want to stick to a daily routine to maintain my wellbeing, and the Bootcamp schedule.
