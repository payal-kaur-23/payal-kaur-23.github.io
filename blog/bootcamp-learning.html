    <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
    <p>
        The biggest strenghts will be working alongside people that are in the same boat as me. It will helpful as in person you can get help there and then.
        The biggest limitations will be making and sticking to a timeframe as in foundations it was all online based with no limit to when and what time. Working with a team will help resolve that issue
