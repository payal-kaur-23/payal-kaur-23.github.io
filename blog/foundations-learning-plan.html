    <div class="content-block"></div>
    <h2>What is my long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
    <p> I want to transition into a developer role at a company. Start off small and then climb my way up. I can potentially work on side-projects that cover both  until I can transition design and development until i get a full-time job.
