    <h1>Foundations Learning Plan</h1>
    <h2>What is my long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
    
    <p> I want to transition into a developer role at a company. Start off small and then climb my way up. I can potentially work on side-projects that cover both  until I can transition design and development until i get a full-time job.
    </p>

    <h2>What are my strengths and limitations when it comes to learning?</h2>
    
    <p>
    My strenghts are i know exactly what i want and can come up with conepts. The limitations are that i can not implement as i envisioned in the timeline that i want.
    </p>

    <h2>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would I like to see developed in myself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
    
    <p>
   I would like to develope more confidence in human skills. For example, be more confident in public speaking and meeting new people
    </p>

    <h2>How will I manage my workload in this programme?</h2>
    
    <p>
   I like to stick to a daily routine so i know that i am completing the work that is required but also having some personal time as well.
    </p>

    <h2>How and where will I seek help in a timely way?</h2>
    
    <p>
   I firstly try to google to see if there is a solution. If i can not find anything then i ask for help from my partner that has more experience in coding. If that still does not resolve the issue then i ask for help on the Dev academy discord server.
    </p>

    <h2>What do I expect from the Facilitation team?</h2>
    
    <p>
        guidance and help when i need it or when they see fit.
    </p>

    <h2>How have I scheduled my study time vs blocked-out time?
    </h2>
    
    <p>
     I use toggl track to help me stay on top of my daily routine.
    </p>
