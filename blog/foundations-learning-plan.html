    <h1>Foundations Learning Plan</h1>

    <div class="content-block">
    <h2>What is my long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
    <p> I want to transition into a developer role at a company. Start off small and then climb my way up. I can potentially work on side-projects that cover both  until I can transition design and development until i get a full-time job.
    </p>

    <h2>What are my strengths and limitations when it comes to learning?</h2>

    <div class="content-block">
    <h2>How and where will I seek help in a timely way?</h2>
    <p>
   I firstly try to google to see if there is a solution. If i can not find anything then i ask for help from my partner that has more experience in coding. If that still does not resolve the issue then i ask for help on the Dev academy discord server.
    </p>
</div>

    <div class="content-block">
