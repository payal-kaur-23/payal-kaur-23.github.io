    <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>

    <h2>What is neuroplasticity and how can I utilise it?</h2>
   
    
    <p>
        Your brain develops a "pathway" for how to remember or carry out the things you learn or do. The more times you repeat or think back on something, like moving through grass that is tall, you'll notice how distinct that particular pathway becomes. But if you don't use it, the grass will ultimately take over.
    </p>
    <p>
        Knowledge is always built upon prior knowledge since paths also build off of current pathways. Additionally, a route is more likely to be preserved if it contains more connections.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may intentionally create paths to the knowledge we want to acquire and the habits we want to establish by being aware of how our brains function.Then, to boost my neuroplasticity, I'd constantly work on the skills I want to develop (such as jogging, touch-typing, or new habits), keep using the information I want to remember, and learn by expanding on the ideas I already know.
    </p>
    

    <h2>What is a growth mindset and how is this related to neuroplasticity?</h2>
   
    
    <p>
        Recognizing that everything can be learnt and that your current state is not "fixed" is what it means to have a development mindset.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is related to neuroplasticity since overcoming the sense of being stuck—a frequent sign of a fixed mindset—requires creating new brain connections, either via repetition or by building on previously acquired knowledge.

    </p>


    <h2>How will these understandings influence my learning strategy?</h2>
   
    <p>
        I will continue at the times when I feel stuck rather than procrastinating because I know that I am capable of change and that it is almost certainly going to happen. So instead of trying for fear, I'll strive for  enthusiasm!
