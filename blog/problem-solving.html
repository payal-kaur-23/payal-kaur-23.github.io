    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>

    <div class="content-block">
    <h2> Describe a time when I was blocked on a simple problem</h2>
    
    <p>
    I observed that after completing the JavaScript Kata activities, the solutions frequently appeared straightforward. However, I often felt trapped when attempting to solve problems and was continuously perplexed as to why I wasn't receiving the desired results. Since I could console.log each result as I worked through the challenges and it was simpler to access resources online for the smaller pieces I was attempting to resolve, I discovered that breaking the problems down into smaller chunks was a huge help.
    </p>
    <p>
        These tiny victories served as encouragement to complete the remainder of each workout. Therefore, the key lesson I learned was that when I feel stuck, it's generally a good idea to break the issue down further and focus on the tiny victories.

          <td>Although I truly like the current pseudocode in the exercises we've been given, I don't write my own pseudocode very frequently, so I'm eager to develop this habit—especially as tasks get difficult.</td>

          <th>Trying something</th>

     <h2>Describe a time when I elegantly solved a problem</h2>
    
      <p>
      I was having issues with the activity Inflate-the-unicorn. There was a bug ikn my code so i checked with my coach and rewrote the whole code so the bug could be fixed
      </p>

    <div class="content-block">
      <h2>Reflect on a time when I was reluctant to ask for help
    </h2>
    
      <p>
       It would be the same issue for Inflate-the-unicorn. I reaally wanted to fix the issue myself but at the end it just costed me time. As soon as i asked for help then the issue was clear and was fixable.
