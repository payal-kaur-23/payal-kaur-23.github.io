    <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>

    <h2>What is emotional intelligence?</h2>

     <p>
        The ability to recognize and control your own feelings as well as comprehend and empathize with those of others is known as emotional intelligence. David Goleman, a psychologist, popularized this idea by identifying five important characteristics for an individual who has high emotional intelligence: self-awareness, self-regulation, self-motivation, empathic towards other people, as well as strong social skills.
    </p>

    <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>

    <p>
        While IQ (Intelligence Quotient) assesses mental prowess, EQ (Emotional Quotient) measures a person's emotional intelligence. While IQ is thought to be more fixed, EQ can be developed via experiences, introspection, and practice.
   </p>
 
   <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>

   <p>
    Given that you'll typically have good connections with others and with yourself, having a high EQ usually means you'll be happier and more content with life. This then has a favorable effect on a variety of aspects of your life, including career, family, and personal development. Additionally, you're more prone to experience low stress, fewer conflicts, and flexibility to change.
