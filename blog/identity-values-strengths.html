    <h1>Identity, Values, and Strengths</h1>
    <h2>
        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.

    <p>
        During the first lockdown in New Zealand, I had just started work in a collection comapny. It was certianly a tough time as many people lost their jobs. Working at that company was tough as we were still required to call up and ask for money. I have talked to many people ad heard many heartbreaking stories.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of the people I talked to you that stuck out, was really going through a tough time.She had no family,no friends and no income. She was injured and could't work. She started breaking down. As a employee of the company i am required to discuss payments but as a person how can i do that in that sort of situation.
    </p>
    <p>
     I stayed on that call for an hour and looked into places that can help her. helped her contact foodbanks in her area, helped her by researching what finacial help she can get from the government and anything else she can be qualifed for. I put the account on hold until that was sorted and once she was approved she came and set up a payment plan. By doing this i helped the person but also stayed within company policy and ethics.

    <h2>
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.
    </h2>
    
    
    <p>
        I am Fijian Sikh. I come from a culture where family is everything and everyone is there for everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
        My identity and values solely use to revolve around my family and community but now i am figuring out who i am as a individual.Its very diffult to break out of the habbit of thinking like the rest of the family and having my own opinion but as i starting learning more and growing, the more easier it gets.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.
    </h2>
    
     <p>
       One of my core strenghts is that i am a quick learner, which will be useful in coding as its fast paced and there is a lot of information,
    </p>

    <h2>
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?
    </h2>
    
    <p>
        I have never done coding before starting Dev academy. I have done a few online courses but never anything like this. I feel like i need more knowledge then i currently. I will work towards getting better everyday and practise until i get where i want to.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
    </h2>
    
    
    <p>
      I have always been the youngest in all the teams i have been in. The next oldest was usually 20 years older then i was. As i was the youngest my ideas were not given much consideration or looked over. Most wouldn't take my opions seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
       The things i did were to make sure i always still participate and share my ideas but in a more respectful way. I also tried becoming friends with my team and tried making more of a peaceful enviroment. I would do the same today as well because it creates a good team enviroment.
