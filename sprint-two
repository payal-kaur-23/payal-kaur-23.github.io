    <h1>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h1>
    
    
    <p>Border is the strip that goes around your div/element of the content. Padding is the space between the content and the border. Margin is the space outside the border.
        Content + Padding + Border + Margin = Total Space.Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
        Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
        Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent</p>
